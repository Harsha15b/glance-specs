Rocky Review Priorities
=======================

The Rocky review priorities were discussed at the Dublin PTG and refined
during the spec review process early in the Rocky cycle.  The preliminary
list was maintained on the `Rocky PTG etherpad`_.

This list is an estimate of what the Glance project team can accomplish
during the Rocky cycle based on our developers' estimates of how much
time they can commit to Glance.  If additional resources become available,
it's possible that some of the :doc:`../specs/untargeted/index` could be
added to Rocky.

The following list is roughly in priority order (highest to lowest).
