==================================
Untargeted Approved Specifications
==================================

The following specs have been reviewed and approved but have
not been targeted for a release because the proposer is no longer
available to work on the implementation.

If you are interested in picking one of these up, please put an
item on the agenda for the next convenient `Glance meeting`_ so
that we can quickly discuss whether the spec is still relevant and
also so that the Glance community is aware that you'd like to work
on implementing one of these specs.
