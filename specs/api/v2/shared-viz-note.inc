.. note::
   The ``shared`` value for an image's ``visiblity`` property was introduced in
   version 2.5 of the Image API.  From version 2.5 on, a necessary condition
   for image member calls to succeed is that the ``visibility`` field of the
   image referred to in the call has the value ``shared``.
